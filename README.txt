RedditSavedPostsDownloader: saves all your Reddit saved posts as .html files so you can view them offline.  Useful for if your account gets banned or if they delete the originals eventually. 

v 1.0:  Does exactly what it claims to do: go through your saved posts on Reddit and saves them to a file in the working directory.  Be sure to read the following (also included as a comment in the original program):

# IMPORTANT: This program will not run "as is".  You have to provide your
# own API secret key and reddit log-in info.  Since it's private info, I
# put in placeholders.  Use this video to learn how to get your own secret
# key for your account.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Pie-uoDYG4 I assume 
# you have a reddit account if you're using this program anyway since the whole 
# point of it is to download your own saved posts.  It won't give you access to 
# anyone else's since it's private info. 
# Note: if your saved file loads for a split second and then turns white, it's
# because your pop up blocker is misconfigured. Try opening it in a different
# browser and your webpage will load correctly.
